        <h2>Machine Learning Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on analyzing basketball statistics, specifically the three-point shooting performance across various seasons.</p>
        <p>Technologies used in this project include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Python</strong>: The primary programming language for data processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Pandas</strong>: For data manipulation and handling CSV files.</li>
            <li><strong>Numpy</strong>: For performing numerical operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Matplotlib</strong>: For visualizing data through plots.</li>
            <li><strong>Scikit-learn</strong>: To implement linear regression analysis to identify trends in shooting performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The main goal is to compute total three-point field goals made and attempted, and to analyze trends over seasons using linear regression.</p>

        <!-- Summary Section -->
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>This project utilizes data collected from Basketball Reference, covering the last 24 seasons of professional basketball. The analysis focuses on three-point field goals (3P) made and attempted (3PA), aiming to identify trends in shooting performance and the increasing significance of three-point shooting in basketball. Preliminary findings suggest a substantial growth in three-point attempts and makes, indicating a shift in offensive strategy. By employing data processing techniques and linear regression, this project aims to contribute valuable insights into how the game of basketball has evolved over the years.</p>

        <h2>Data Collected</h2>
        <p>The dataset for this project comes from Basketball Reference, covering 24 seasons of basketball statistics focused on three-point field goals (3P and 3PA). This extensive timeframe allows for analysis of trends in the growing importance of three-point shooting in influencing game strategies.</p>

        <h2>Data Pre-Processing</h2>
        <p>Critical data pre-processing steps were undertaken, including cleaning missing data, formatting columns to numeric types, removing invalid records, and potentially normalizing data ranges. These steps ensure the dataset is accurate and reliable for analysis.</p>

        <h2>Data Analysis Insights</h2>
        <p>The analysis reveals a clear trend of increasing three-point attempts and makes, reflecting a shift in basketball strategies where teams prioritize three-point shooting. This trend illustrates the competitive advantage of effective long-range shooting, reinforcing its role as a cornerstone of modern basketball.</p>

        <h2>Algorithms</h2>
        <p>A Linear Regression model was used to analyze the relationship between seasons and total three-point field goals made. This algorithm effectively identifies trends over time, with the slope indicating the rate of increase in three-point shots made per season. Visualization tools like Matplotlib were employed to create plots for better interpretation of the data.</p>

        <!-- Python Code Display -->
        <h2>Python Code for Linear Regression</h2>
        <pre><code># Prepare the data for linear regression
X = totals_df['Season_Num'].values.reshape(-1, 1)  # Predictor variable (Seasons as 0-1, 1-2, etc.)
y = totals_df['Total 3P'].values  # Response variable (Total 3P)

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict values
y_pred = model.predict(X)

# Print the linear regression coefficients
print(f'Linear Regression Coefficient (slope): {model.coef_[0]}')
print(f'Linear Regression Intercept: {model.intercept_}')</code></pre>

        <h2>Challenges Encountered</h2>
        <p>Throughout this project, several challenges have emerged, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Quality Issues:</strong> Encountering missing or inconsistent data entries has required meticulous cleaning to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Complexity in Data Manipulation:</strong> Handling various data formats and ensuring all entries were properly normalized posed a challenge during pre-processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Algorithm Selection:</strong> Deciding on the most appropriate machine learning algorithm required a deeper understanding of their respective advantages and limitations, leading to some trial and error.</li>
            <li><strong>Ordering the dates from smallest to largest:</strong> On the Y-axis of the graph, the values are not ordered from smallest to largest, as I am using the names of the files to represent them on the Y-axis.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>References and Resources</h2>
        <p>The primary source of data is Basketball Reference, supplemented by various textbooks and online resources. These resources provided insights into best practices for data collection and cleaning, algorithm selection, and effective visualization techniques to present results clearly and effectively.</p>
